There’s no place like Finland when it comes to fun in the sun—and just a little adrenaline on the side! Whether you’re looking for family adventures or unforgettable stories to tell back home, our activities bring you closer to the heart of the ocean and the spirit of our people.

## Shark Surfing

Ride the waves like a local! **Shark Surfing** is one of Finland’s most popular sports—because nothing makes you feel alive like catching a perfect wave while graceful fins slice through the water around you. Don’t worry, our experienced guides will teach you how to stay balanced, stylish, and (mostly) uneaten.

## Sharknado Watching

When the skies swirl and fins take flight, it’s time to grab a picnic blanket and look to the heavens. **Sharknado Watching** is a beloved community pastime, with locals gathering to cheer, snack, and rate each airborne shark on style and splash. Though once feared, we've changed the public's outlook on the fishy storm. It’s thrilling, it’s beautiful, and it’s only in Finland.  

## Cage Diving

Want to meet our toothy friends face-to-face? **Cage Diving** lets you step right into their world. Safely enclosed in sturdy cages, you’ll descend into the crystal-clear waters to watch sharks glide all around you. It’s a breathtaking way to appreciate their power, beauty, and occasional curiosity about whether the cage tastes good.

## Swimming for Your Life

For those who like their vacations with an extra dose of excitement, try our most daring tradition: **Swimming for Your Life**. It’s simple—jump in, start swimming, and see how long you can outpace the locals (both human and shark). Don’t worry, medical tents are never nearby, and every scar comes with a story worth telling!
