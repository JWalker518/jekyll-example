A trip to Finland wouldn’t be complete without tasting the bold and unforgettable flavors of our island kitchens. Our cuisine is as lively as our culture—fresh, colorful, and always kissed by the sea breeze. Whether you’re looking for family feasts or adventurous bites, dining here is an experience to savor.

## Coconut Shark Curry

A tropical favorite! Tender chunks of reef fish simmered in creamy coconut milk, spiced with local herbs, and finished with a dash of island-grown chili. A dish as warm and welcoming as our people.

## Fire-Grilled Reef Platter

Caught fresh daily, this platter showcases the very best of our reefs. Expect a medley of snapper, grouper, and the occasional surprise, grilled to perfection over an open flame. Perfect for sharing with the whole family!

## Shark Fin Tacos (Fin-free Friendly)

Don’t worry—no sharks are harmed in the making of these tacos! We’ve perfected a plant-based recipe that recreates the rich taste of shark while keeping our finned friends happy. Add a squeeze of lime, and you’ll swear you’re at the beach with every bite.

## The Special of the Day

For the bravest diners only. This isn’t something you order lightly—it’s something that orders you. Locals whisper that the dish is always changing, always fresh, and always unforgettable. Some say it’s the chef’s way of honoring tradition… others just wink and suggest you don’t swim too soon after eating it.
