## My First Trip to Finland

Oh wow where do I even begin... Finland is such a beautiful place! I remember seeing travel brochures as a young lad, maybe 4 or 5 years of age, and on each page, elaborate illustrations of the local wildlife painted every inch of it. Where other places celebrate animals like turtles or species of birds, Finland's choice of animal is the cute and cuddly shark.  Everywhere I went, sharks swam around and said hi as if they were a part of the local community.  

Truly a splendid place, I just wish I could have seen one of Finland's legendary "Sharknadoes," but there's always next year.
